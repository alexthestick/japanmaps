# Store Card Sizing & Panel Alignment - Prompt for Next AI Session

## Current State (Stable - Commit 0712d60)
‚úÖ **Structural Fix Complete:** Right panel is now INSIDE the hero flex container
‚úÖ **Layout Working:** Both preview and store panels display correctly
‚úÖ **Issue:** Store cards are too small, right panel needs to be bigger

---

## Goal
Make store cards BIGGER to match the Kirby Air Ride aesthetic reference, and ensure both panels align properly at the bottom with balanced proportions.

### Reference: Kirby Air Ride Map Layout
- Large prominent map/preview area (left)
- Side panel with city names/info displayed prominently (right)
- Cards/tiles in right panel are **substantially sized** - not cramped
- Clear visual hierarchy with good breathing room
- Both areas have similar vertical heights
- Visual balance: preview is the hero, but side panel is clearly visible and usable

## Current Structure (DO NOT CHANGE)
```
motion.div (min-h-screen flex flex-col)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Masthead (minHeight: 140px)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Hero section (flex flex-1)  ‚Üê Line 760
      ‚îú‚îÄ Left Panel (flex-[78]) ‚Üê Takes 78% width
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Glow Container (aspect-[16/10])
      ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ Preview Image
      ‚îÇ
      ‚îî‚îÄ Right Panel (flex-[22]) ‚Üê Takes 22% width, h-full
          ‚îú‚îÄ FEATURED header
          ‚îî‚îÄ StorePreviews grid (2x3)
              ‚îî‚îÄ 6 store cards (aspect-[1/1], magenta borders)
```

---

## Store Cards Current Specs
- **Grid:** 2 columns √ó 3 rows
- **Aspect ratio:** `aspect-[1/1]` (perfect squares)
- **Gap:** `6px`
- **Border:** `3px solid ${cityColor}`
- **Size:** Currently cramped, need ~30-40% larger

## What Caused Previous Mistakes (CRITICAL - AVOID!)

### Mistake #1: `justify-center` on Hero Container
**What happened:** Changed hero container from `justify-start` to `justify-center`, then back
**Why it broke:** Centering caused panels to compress inward instead of expand outward
**What we learned:** When using flex proportions (flex-[78] and flex-[22]), NEVER use `justify-center` - use `justify-start` to let them expand
**Safe approach:** Keep hero as `flex flex-1 overflow-visible justify-center items-start` EXACTLY as is

### Mistake #2: Changing Flex Proportions Without Constraints
**What happened:** Changed from flex-[78]/flex-[22] to flex-[75]/flex-[25] without constraints
**Why it broke:** Left panel's content (aspect ratio) would force shrinking if not properly constrained
**What we learned:** Flex proportions alone don't work - need `min-w-0` on expanding items OR explicit max-height on constrained items
**Safe approach:** Leave current flex proportions (78/22), they're balanced

### Mistake #3: Removing Aspect Ratio from Preview
**What happened:** Replaced `aspect-[16/10]` with `max-h-[500px]`
**Why it broke:** Preview became invisible/broken, aspect ratio is the KEY constraint
**What we learned:** The aspect ratio is NOT the enemy - it ensures preview maintains proper proportions
**Safe approach:** Keep `aspect-[16/10]` on glow container, this is correct and necessary

### Mistake #4: Not Understanding Height Hierarchy
**What happened:** Didn't realize hero section's height is determined by left panel's content (via aspect ratio)
**Why it broke:** Tried to "fix" vertical space by changing aspect ratio, broke preview
**What we learned:** 
- Hero section height = left panel's natural height (aspect ratio driven)
- Right panel automatically gets same height via `h-full`
- Increasing store card size must happen WITHIN the right panel's available space, not by changing hero height
**Safe approach:** Work WITHIN the right panel constraints, don't try to expand hero section height

## Safe Sizing Strategy (ONLY Change These)

### Option 1: Increase Store Card Grid Gap (Simplest)
**What to change:** Line 200 in StorePreviews component
```
Current: gap: '6px'
Try: gap: '10px' or '12px'
```
**Why it's safe:** Only affects card spacing, doesn't change layout structure
**Impact:** Cards will appear slightly larger due to larger gaps between them

### Option 2: Reduce Right Panel Padding (Medium Complexity)
**What to change:** Line 935 in CitiesPage (right panel)
```
Current: px-3 py-1
Try: px-2 py-0 (tighter) or px-1 (very tight)
```
**Why it's safe:** Only affects internal padding, doesn't change flex proportions
**Impact:** Cards get more space to expand within right panel

### Option 3: Increase Right Panel Width (CAREFUL - Most Complex)
**What to change:** Line 935 in CitiesPage
```
Current: flex-[22] (22% of 100)
Try: flex-[24] or flex-[25] (carefully test)
```
**Why it's risky:** Must pair with adjusting left panel to maintain proportions
**If doing this:** Also change left panel (line 766) from `flex-[78]` to `flex-[76]` or `flex-[75]`
**Critical:** Use `min-w-0` on left panel to prevent it from squeezing
**Test after each change:** Must verify preview doesn't disappear

### Option 4: Adjust Store Card Aspect Ratio (AVOID if Possible)
**What to change:** Line 54 in StorePreviewCard
```
Current: aspect-[1/1]
Try: aspect-[4/3] (wider cards)
```
**Why it's risky:** Changes card proportions, must test hover effects and clip-path
**Only do this if:** Card images look distorted or stretched

## Testing Checklist (MUST Do After Changes)

After making ANY sizing change:
1. ‚úÖ Preview image is visible and shows correctly
2. ‚úÖ FEATURED header shows at top of right panel
3. ‚úÖ All 6 store cards visible in 2√ó3 grid
4. ‚úÖ Store cards not clipped at bottom
5. ‚úÖ Bottom of preview panel aligns with bottom of right panel
6. ‚úÖ Hover effects work on store cards
7. ‚úÖ Landing mode (mystery city) still works
8. ‚úÖ No scrollbars appear (one-page layout)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Conservative Increase (Safest)
1. Increase grid gap from `6px` ‚Üí `10px` (or `12px`)
2. Test and verify everything works
3. Reduce right panel padding: `px-3` ‚Üí `px-2`
4. Test again

### Phase 2: If More Size Needed
1. Adjust card aspect ratio if images look wrong
2. Consider slight width increase (flex-[22] ‚Üí flex-[23] or flex-[24])
3. Test carefully after each change

### Phase 3: Final Tweaks
1. Fine-tune gaps and padding
2. Verify alignment at bottom
3. Test on different city selections
4. Test landing mode

## Git Commit Strategy
- Commit AFTER each successful test
- Use descriptive messages: `üìä SIZING: Increase gap to 10px - Store cards appear larger`
- If breaks: `git revert [commit-hash]` immediately
- Never make multiple sizing changes in one commit

---

## Commands Reference
```bash
# View git history
git log --oneline -10

# Revert to last good state
git checkout [commit-hash] -- src/pages/CitiesPage.tsx

# View current changes
git diff src/pages/CitiesPage.tsx

# Restart dev server (clean)
pkill -9 -f "npm run dev" 2>/dev/null; sleep 2 && npm run dev
```

## Final Notes
- The structural fix (right panel inside flex container) is SOLID and WORKING
- Store cards ARE visible and functional at current size
- We're now ONLY adjusting sizing, not architecture
- Small incremental changes are safer than large rewrites
- Always test after each single change
- When in doubt, revert and try a different approach

Good luck! This structure is now stable and ready for conservative sizing improvements.
